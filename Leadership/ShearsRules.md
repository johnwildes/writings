# Shear's Rules
From CDR Ed Shear USN / NOSC Chicago circa 2011

1. Don't hit anything. To do that use bering and bearing rate, range and range rate, and lastly keep your eyes on them because they lie to you.
2. Be precise, a lack of precision is dangerous when the margin of error is small.
3. You can't play the game if you don't know the rules.
4. If you are early you are on time, if you are on time you are late, if you are late you are in trouble.
5. The life we lead is not a dress rehearsal.
6. Be impeccable with your word.
7. Don't take it personally.
8. Do your best at all times.  Understand that your best on one day is not the same as your best on another day.
9. Don't make assumptions.  Dig deeper, ask questions until you are sure you have the correct meaning.
10. TNSTAAFL (pronounced tin-stah-ful) There's NO Such Thing As A Free Lunch.
11. Believe in the "Power of One".
12. Use and understand the "Rule of three".
13. Give more than you take.
14. Never have more than 10 Rules.
